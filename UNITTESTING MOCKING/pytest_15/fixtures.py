# WHAT ARE FIXTURES
"""
Software test fixtures initialize test functions. They provide a fixed baseline so
that tests execute reliably and produce consistent, repeatable, results.
Initialization may set up services, state, or other operating environments.
These are accessed by test functions through arguments; for each fixture used
by a test function there is typically a parameter (named after the fixture) in
the test functionâ€™s definition.
